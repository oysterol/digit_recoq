# digit_recoq

This digit recognition is based on the math found in "http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/" and is written from scratch. The Neural Network can easily
be fed other data.(In this particular scipt the scipy digits are used.) Neural_network file contains the math. The Letter_recogn_frame contains Accuracy,
the training_NN_digit which trains the model predictions and so on. The Output NN i.e the weights is saved to a npy file, and an easy function to recreate the NN is implemented.
This was made soley for me to learn and is probably alittle rough around the edges, but it does work.
